     git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fortress-ascendancy.git
     ```
  4. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd fortress-ascendancy
     ```
- **Set Up SSH (Optional)**:
  - Follow GitHubâ€™s [SSH setup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for secure access.

### **6. Install Export Templates for Godot**
1. Go to `Editor` > `Manage Export Templates` in Godot.
2. Download the official templates directly within Godot.
3. Verify templates are installed under `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\Godot\export_templates`.

### **7. Test the Environment**
1. Open a simple scene in Godot to verify the project runs correctly:
   - Run the game using the play button in Godot.
2. Check script integration by opening and editing a GDScript file in Visual Studio Code.

---

### **8. Set Up Build and Deployment Workflow**
- Use Godotâ€™s built-in export system:
  1. Go to `Project` > `Export`.
  2. Add platforms you plan to build for (e.g., Windows, macOS).
  3. Set up export settings (e.g., include `.pck` files).

---

### **9. Document the Setup**
- Create a `README.md` in the repository to document:
  - Required tools.
  - Setup instructions.
  - Links to assets and resources.

---

### **10. Final Steps**
- Join the teamâ€™s communication platform (Slack, Discord, or other).
- Set up access to the shared repository for assets (e.g., art, sound).
- Start by following your assigned modular tasks from the *Technical Design Document*.
