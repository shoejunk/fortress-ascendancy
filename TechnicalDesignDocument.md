## Technical Breakdown

### Game Systems

#### 1. **Hovercraft Movement System**
**Objective:** Implement omnidirectional movement with smooth physics.
- **Modules:**
  - `MovementController.gd`
    - Handles input mapping (keyboard and gamepad).
    - Implements physics-based acceleration, deceleration, and precision mode.
  - `FuelSystem.gd`
    - Tracks fuel consumption during movement and boosts.
    - Integrates with fuel pickups and refueling stations.
- **Steps:**
  1. Create a `RigidBody2D` for the hovercraft.
  2. Add physics calculations for velocity and acceleration.
  3. Implement fuel consumption logic tied to movement and boosts.
  4. Write unit tests for edge cases (e.g., fuel depletion during movement).

#### 2. **Combat System**
**Objective:** Build primary and secondary weapon mechanics.
- **Modules:**
  - `WeaponController.gd`
    - Handles primary (pulse cannon) and secondary (missiles, EMPs, cluster bombs) weapons.
  - `AmmoManager.gd`
    - Manages ammo counts and reloading.
  - `MeleeRam.gd`
    - Boosts into enemies, causing damage and overheating.
- **Steps:**
  1. Design weapon firing logic using `Area2D` for collision detection.
  2. Implement weapon effects (e.g., particle systems for explosions).
  3. Add overheating logic for the melee ram.
  4. Test for weapon balancing (e.g., damage per second).

#### 3. **AI System**
**Objective:** Create basic and advanced AI behaviors for enemies.
- **Modules:**
  - `AIStateMachine.gd`
    - Implements state transitions (patrolling, attacking, alerting).
  - `BossAI.gd`
    - Manages multi-phase boss behaviors.
- **Steps:**
  1. Design state machines for grunt AI.
  2. Extend with behavior trees for bosses.
  3. Test enemy responses to player actions.

#### 4. **Level System**
**Objective:** Build modular and reusable levels.
- **Modules:**
  - `LevelManager.gd`
    - Handles loading and unloading of levels.
  - `PuzzleManager.gd`
    - Manages switches, gates, and environmental interactions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use Tiled Map Editor to create level layouts.
  2. Import and integrate maps into Godot.
  3. Add interactive elements like destructible terrain.
  4. Test level transitions and environmental hazards.

#### 5. **HUD System**
**Objective:** Display player stats and objectives.
- **Modules:**
  - `HUD.gd`
    - Manages health bars, fuel gauges, and mini-maps.
  - `ObjectiveTracker.gd`
    - Tracks and displays active objectives.
- **Steps:**
  1. Design the UI layout in Godot’s CanvasLayer.
  2. Implement real-time updates for health, ammo, and fuel.
  3. Test responsiveness across screen resolutions.

#### 6. **Save System**
**Objective:** Save player progress and settings.
- **Modules:**
  - `SaveManager.gd`
    - Handles save and load operations using JSON.
- **Steps:**
  1. Design a JSON schema for game saves.
  2. Implement save checkpoints in levels.
  3. Test save/load functionality.
