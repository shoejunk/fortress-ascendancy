I want you to design a game similar to Fort Apocalypse, but make it your own. Write a design document that is detailed enough such that I can pass this to a game development company and they would be able to write it based on your document. The game should be 2d. It should have beautiful modern graphics. You should come up with a compelling setting. You should describe the game mechanics in detail. You should explain each screen in the game, what the objetives are, how to win, how to attack, what kind of enemies there are, etc.
