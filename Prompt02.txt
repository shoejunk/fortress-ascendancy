You are a highly experienced tech director in the game industry with over 20 years of experience. I want you to make high level technical recommendations for the technologies you would use to make the game described in the attached DesignDocument.md. Include whether you would create a game engine from scratch or use an existing game engine. Also break down any other technology you would employ, 3rd party open source libraries, build tools, dependency managers, IDEs, etc. This is for an indie game company with a very low budget.
