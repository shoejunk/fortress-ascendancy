You are a highly experienced tech director in the game industry with over 20 years of experience. Based on the attached DesignDocument.md and HighLevelTechnicalOverview.md I want you to create a detailed technical design document that breaks down every engineering aspect of the game and lays out the steps needed to complete the game step-by-step. You're going to be working with a team of low-level engineers so you need to lay things out in a clear, easy to follow manner. Also, all engineers are going to be remote with little communication between each other, so each piece of work needs to be as modular as possible.
